## About me... 

I love **efficiency**, I don't like when things don't work as they are meant to work. Making me a natural **problem solver**. 
Throughout my education I mainly focused on my **creative** strengths, then I reaslised I wanted to challenge myself and go towards a more academic route. Contrary to what my teachers thought I went for it. I do not believe that something being difficult is a good enough reason not to try. Me being *dyslexic* plays a big part in me finding things more difficult but I don't let that stop me either, making me **resilient**.
